          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          I had a situation in a group of friends where some people sided with one person ebcause of a certain incident and others sided with a person on the other side. Not being someone who likes to be put into one category or another, I naturally decided to avoid picking a side in the conflict and instead endeavoured to maintain neutrality. In fact, I do not think I would have much of a differing opinion now as I am very conflict-avoidant and still prefer neutrality in a given situation.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
          I consider myself to be made up of pieces of everyone around me - I have the same sense of humour as my brothers, my favourite band is the same as that of a girl I was interested in in highschool, I have my dad's handwriting, I still tell the same joke a friend told me in 2019, I drink the same whiskey as a friend from university, I even talk similarly to one of my closest friends. Much the same way, my values tend to be cherrypicked due to circumstance and experience, rather than getting them from people I take them from lessons I've learnt from difficult situations I've been put in. This has meant that they have changed somewhat throughout the years - I've gone from quite extroverted and people-centric to much more introspective and finding the joy in one's own company for example.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
          According to the Strength Finder provided my five strengths are, in order of impact, 5. Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence, 4. Curiosity, 3. Humour, 2. Kindness and 1. Creativity. I think the benefit of having creativity as my biggest strength will be immense throughout this course as it will help in both design and technical aspects - allowing for creative solutions to technical problems and a unique approach to the visual design aspects.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          I think a major limitation for me in previous environments is simply boredom, where I have become too comfortable and stagnant in a given situation and stopped growign any aspect of myself as a consequence. Hopefully thsi will not be an issue with this course due to it's fast paced and intensive nature, although conversely there may be situations where I'm pushed far beyond my usual comfort zone which may be a source of some stress or anxiety.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
          At my last job of the three people I happened to managing one fo them was being fairly rude and unhelpful, and so my strategy was to simply ignore him and use the combined efforts of myself and the other two to complete the work that needed to be done at the time. Looking back I probably could have been more tactful in negotiating with the difficult individual and finding a middle ground where we would've both walked away much happier at the end of the day.</p>
