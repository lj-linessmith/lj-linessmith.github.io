            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?
          </b>
          <br />
          I've discovered that although I went in with the mindset of the
          freedom of work style would be beneficial for me, I would actually
          prefer a more structured style of work environment - hopefully this
          will be better moving into bootcamp. I think I also was expecting to
          get as frustrated with certain styles of learning such as the "test"
          style systems of simply outputting red or green depending on if code
          was working, but looking back through my reflections there is a pretty
          clear theme that these did not really work for me throughout
          foundations. Additionally, I've discovered how much emotional balance
          and self-reflection can effect productivity and work satisfactio, as
          when I was struggling with these aspects there was a clear and
          noticeable difference in the efficiency and quality of work produced.

            and programming?</b
          >
          <br />
          Each of these skills are vital to both learning and programming in
          often similar ways: Values are important as they guide you to what you
          want to achieve (learning) and create (programming). They guide help
          one to stay focussed on the end goal of either of these pursuits, and
          staying close to one's values will ensure that you are working towards
          that which is both important and rewarding.

          <b> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
          <br />
          I think I was surprised by how relevant a lot of these soft skills
          were relevant to coding specifically - I was aware that these sorts of
          things would be beneficial for say, working in a team or looking for a
          job, but the benefit of understanding these skills better is also
          incredibly beneficial for the actual act of programming itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</b>
          <br />
          I tended to find that the most challenging aspect was trying to
          properly dive deep into what was being emphasised and asked about and
          not fall into the trap of simply brushing over the content with
          minimal effort, but rather making sure I spent a proper amount of time
          exploring and reflecting what was being covered in the core sections.

          <b
            >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?</b
          >
          <br />
          As mentioned above, I think it's very helpful for the actual act of
          coding itself, but additionally the aim of this course is for setting
          uo an entry into the workplace, where these sorts of skills will be
          very useful for both applying for jobs and working in a team
          environment, as so many jobs in this industry are.

            >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of tme? Should you have just used that time to practice
            programming instead? Justify your answer.</b
          >
          <br />
          For me I think the amount of time spent completing core work felt
          reasonable as although it was certainly not an insignificant amount of
          time, it felt like it was about right in proportion to the amount of
          time I spent completing the programming work - probably about 15-20%
          of my time was spent on Core which feels like about the right amount
          as it didn't ever feel like I was wasting my time not being focussed
          on coding, but also was significant enough to properly take time to
          process and understand the relevant content.
