          JavaScript is a key part of the website building process, just like
          HTML and CSS. It works like the Technic parts in a Lego set, while
          HTML is the bricks and CSS is all the fun colours. With just HTML you
          can build something that is <i> shaped </i> like a car, and CSS can
          make it actually have a windscreen and coloured bricks, but you need
          Javascript to make give the car a rocket booster and firing missiles.
          Or something.
        </p>
        <p id="text">A very basic car:</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img id="text" class="focusimage" src="../styles/htmlcar.jfif" />
      </p>
      <p id="text">A slightly cooler looking car:</p>
      <p>
        <img id="text" class="focusimage" src="../styles/csscar.jfif" />
      </p>
      <p id="text">The coolest car you've ever seen:</p>
      <p>
        <img id="text" class="focusimage" src="../styles/javascriptcar.jpg" />
      </p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          So what does this mean practically? Well, Javascript acts the moving
          parts that add functionality and interactive features to a webpage and
          allows control over both input and output of data.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The order in which Javascript works is dictated by the control flow of
          the language. By default, like HTML Javascript works from top to
          bottom, line by line. However, there are several different operations
          which affect this linear flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most common of these is loops. Loops work by, well,
          looping. They continuously repeat a process until they stop at a
          defined point within the code. They work similarly to how a turntable
          for records work, spinning nonstop until it reaches the set end of the
          record and stopping.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The DOM is the "tree" in which all of the code elements are located.
          This is a form of the most common visualisation:
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img id="text" class="focusimage" src="../styles/domtree.jpg" />
      </p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          Certain commands can be used to create "branches" across this tree, to
          access different areas of data. This can be done using say, arrays and
          objects. Let's return to our Lego analogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects are like little treasure chests filled with different pieces -
          information on each of which can be pulled depending on what specific
          piece you ask for - in the case of the image below you could be
          looking for how many gold or silver coins there are, or what colour
          the gem inside is. Each treasure chest would be named uniquely to make
          it easy to find. For example, you could be asking for the colour of
          the gem inside Captain Redbeard's Treasure, and the data you would
          receive would be Red.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img
          id="text"
          class="focusimage"
          src="../styles/javascriptobject.jpg"
        />
      </p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          Arrays on the other hand are like perfectly ordered collections of
          data, in a numerical order with counting starting at 0, and counting
          from there. In the below image, we would start with the droid on the
          left as 0, followed by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (let's ignore old mate
          floating above the rest he just thinks he's sepcial) So if we wanted
          to access the third droid, Keith, we would ask the code to retrieve #3
          from the "Droid Transport" array. Arrays are useful for retrieving
          information on a specific numbered piece of data in an ordered list.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img
          id="text"
          class="focusimage"
          src="../styles/javascriptarray.jfif"
        />
      </p>
      <div id="text2">
        <br />
        <p>
          Functions are modular actions which can be performed by JavaScript at
          any time. This is very useful because you can call upon functions for
          multiple different purposes, like the cars below, which have different
          parts which can be swapped out and used again, like rocket launchers!
          Again! Sick! Functions are very cool and definitely are key part of
          JavaScript.
