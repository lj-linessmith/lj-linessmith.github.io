    <h1 id="h1">Problem Solving</h1>
    <div id="text">
      <p>When were you blocked on a simple problem?</p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          During the Javascript Kata I got stuck on the Gradebook exercise for a
          while. Despite trying multiple approaches, I simply was not getting
          anywhere. I used a (very human-looking) rubber duck to explain my
          problems to, I spent way too long trying to google solutions, and
          still was not getting anywhere. Stepping away from the computer simply
          led to me becoming extremely demotivated by the time I sat back down
          to see the same lines of code staring back at me, menacingly. After
          seeking help the solution simply fell into place due to a syntax
          error. Feeling both liberated and frustrated that I had overlooked
          such a simple solution, I moved on to the next task, telling myself to
          make sure I learn from it and be more careful and precise with the
          code I am writing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>How did you elegantly solve a problem?</p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          After a decent amount of trial-and-error and use of google, the
          solution to the Fizzbuzz challenge simply fell into my lap and worked
          immediately once I tried a new way of looking at the problem. Despite
          the brief early frustration (which seems to be a given when working
          with JavaScript), I was extremely pleased with myself to have such a
          simple, clear and straightforward solution to the problem. Sometimes
          the most simple way of fixing something is the best, and also easiest
          to understand when proofreading.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>How do you feel about different problem solving techniques?</p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          <b>PSEUDOCODE</b> <br />
          Pseudocode is something I'm trying to use as much as possible, and
          although it hasn't exactly <i>solved</i> any problems I've faced, it
          certainly makes finding solutions less intimidating and helps outline
          a clear path to finding a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>TRYING SOMETHING</b> <br />
          Trying something is probably my most used method of problem solving -
          just keep throwing ideas at the wall until something sticks. It
          definitely has to be used in conjunction with other methods, but
          there's nothing better to do than just give whatever ideas I come up
          with a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>RUBBER DUCKY METHOD</b> <br />
          A classic. I currently don't have a rubber ducky in my possession but
          my Funko Pop of a Morrowind character has worked pretty well so far,
          nothing like talking to an inanimate object to remind yourself of your
          sanity. Works sort of like a verbal pseudocode.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>READING ERROR MESSAGES</b> <br />
          Best way to work out what you're doing wrong is to simply look at what
          you're doing wrong. This has been especially helpful when specific
          lines or even words are highlighted as having an error, allowing me to
          zero in on the specific area that is causing a problem. Very helpful
          for finding simple syntax/spelling errors in the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CONSOLE.LOGGING</b> <br />
          One of my most underused problem solving methods, I've found use for
          it in finding what data is stored in a given array etc., but I
          definitely underutilised it until towards the very end of the Kata
          exercises. Something to work on in future, definitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GOOGLING</b> <br />
          If one has a problem with their code, odds are someone has had the
          same problem before. While I have used it a lot, there is definitely a
          downside in that some people will be presenting a solution to a
          <i>very similar</i> problem, but not actually what I'm trying to
          achieve, taking me in the wrong direction of the solution I'm trying
          to find. The internet is, after all, a very fickle beast.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>ASKING PEERS FOR HELP</b> <br />
          Yeah, I'm not great with this or the below. I have a nasty tendency to
          believe that I <i>just need to work on it a little bit longer</i>. The
          few times I have used this it has of course worked well and is simply
          a hurdle in myself that I need to get over, we're all in the same boat
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>ASKING COACHES FOR HELP</b> <br />
          Same story as above. The fact that I was slightly behind due to having
          to catchup on a previous sprint from being sick definitely made me
          feel less inclined to seek help for work I should've completed the
          previous week. :/ Oops.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>IMPROVING YOUR PROCESS WITH REFLECTION</b> <br />
          Unfortunately I've tended to underrate the benefit of doing this, even
          though a lot of the time any given problem I encounter I have no doubt
          solved previously. I'm trying to do better at noting down how I solved
          problems and what things did/didn't work and hopefully this will feel
          more natural with continued practice of this process as it's
          definitely a good way of keeping stock of what things I tend to get
          stuck on.
