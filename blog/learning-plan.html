        <p>
          Moving into Bootcamp, I am looking forward to the more structured
          style of learning as I think this will benefit my productivity. I'm
          also looking forward to having other people working in the same
          physical space - something I did not expect to be missing as much as I
          did during foundations. My people skills will hopefully integrate
          nicely and make interactions pleasant and productive with both other
          students and the DevAcademy staff. However there is also potential for
          easy distraction, something I will have to do my best to avoid and
          hopefully maintain the ability to focus on tasks at hand. I hope to
          have my collaborative skills worked on and improved throughout the
          Bootcamp, as although this is not something I struggle with per se, it
          is something I believe can always be improved upon. I tend to be very
          conflict avoidant, and if some sort of issue does tend to come up
          while working collaboratively, either during the course or in the
          workforce in future, I would like to have a better approach to deal
          with these situations. I hope that the staff on hand during Bootcamp
          are willing and able to prioritise students and be available for
          individual assistance and teaching as well as in a broader class
          environment. Being friendly and treating students respectfully is also
          important to me, as well as a good sense of humour of course. For
          Bootcamp, I want to make sure I am able to focus and be as efficient
          as possible in completing tasks so as to avoid stress of work piling
          up. Additionally, I would like to make sure Iam willing and able to
          reach out for assistance/guidance when needed. I also want to make
          sure that I am fully comprehending a given topic/subject before moving
          on to the next so as to not have to revisit concepts regularly to try
          reteach myself.

          1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? My goal is to find a
          job working as a front-end developer in Wellington to help fund my
          eventual move to Italy to live and work there.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning One of my strengths is creative problem-solving - innovating
          new solutions to problems outside of the conventional or suggested.
          However I am limited by struggling to learn by simply being relayed
          information - I tend to need to practically execute new information
          for a while for the knowledge to properly sink in,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I would like to better
          develop my time management skills as this is something I have
          definitely struggled with in the past and would be useful in both work
          environments and ‘real-life’ situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include: - An explanation of how you will
          manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives I will be
          regularly using time management equipment such as Toggl to make sure I
          am using my time effectively and dividing workloads evenly over the
          period of time in which they need to be completed. - What you will do
          when things are building up and starting to get to you I will take
          time to re-evaluate, contact facilitators where need for help, advice,
          or alternative solutions to problems
        </p>
        <p>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          I will either ask the rest of the course members or the facilitators
          for help depending on the problem when I have begun to spend
          unnecessarily long amounts of time stuck on a single point.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team I would
          expect availability to help and support during reasonable working
          hours throughout the week for issues relating to both work and
          personal wellbeing where applicable, as well as a strong emphasis on
          reasonability and flexibility where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. At
          this stage I do not have any other regular commitments outside of the
          course, although during the Bootcamp I will need to factor in travel
          times to and from the campus.
