          1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? My goal is to find a
          job working as a front-end developer in Wellington to help fund my
          eventual move to Italy to live and work there.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning One of my strengths is creative problem-solving - innovating
          new solutions to problems outside of the conventional or suggested.
          However I am limited by struggling to learn by simply being relayed
          information - I tend to need to practically execute new information
          for a while for the knowledge to properly sink in,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I would like to better
          develop my time management skills as this is something I have
          definitely struggled with in the past and would be useful in both work
          environments and ‘real-life’ situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include: - An explanation of how you will
          manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives I will be
          regularly using time management equipment such as Toggl to make sure I
          am using my time effectively and dividing workloads evenly over the
          period of time in which they need to be completed. - What you will do
          when things are building up and starting to get to you I will take
          time to re-evaluate, contact facilitators where need for help, advice,
          or alternative solutions to problems
        </p>
        <p>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          I will either ask the rest of the course members or the facilitators
          for help depending on the problem when I have begun to spend
          unnecessarily long amounts of time stuck on a single point.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team I would
          expect availability to help and support during reasonable working
          hours throughout the week for issues relating to both work and
          personal wellbeing where applicable, as well as a strong emphasis on
          reasonability and flexibility where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. At
          this stage I do not have any other regular commitments outside of the
          course, although during the Bootcamp I will need to factor in travel
          times to and from the campus.
