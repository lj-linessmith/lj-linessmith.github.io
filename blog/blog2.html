    <div id="text">
      <h2>
        Padding, Margins and Borders all affect the overall "size" of objects,
        or "elements" in CSS formats. But what does that mean anyway, and what
        do they do specifically?
      </h2>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          Padding works like polystyrene between an item in a cardboard box and
          the box itself, creating a space between the item itself and the box
          it is in. It allows for "breathing room" within a box - or element as
          it would be referred to in code - and for precise "floating" spacing
          of objects such as text or images.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this analogy, the Border then is the cardboard box itself,
          containing everything within itself, or the sum total of the element.
          These can be coloured for visual effect, but won't necessarily be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analogy starts to fall apart somewhat once we get to the Margin,
          as this acts as a sort of Padding outside the Border, sort of like if
          our cardboard box had a magical force field around it keeping it from
          touching other cardboard boxes. This means one can use it to keep a
          set space between different elements on a given document or webpage.
