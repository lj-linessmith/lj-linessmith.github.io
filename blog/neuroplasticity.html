          Neuroplasticity is the ability for the physical nature of one's brain
          to be changed throughout learning and training. It involves the
          rewiring of neural pathways and can be affected by both practical
          activity but also simply mental engagement with a given subject or
          skill. This will be useful for me to help deter self critical thoughts
          as well as train specific areas of the brain which will help add
          skills which come across more as intuition than forced application.
          Neuroplasticity is largely based around experience, that is it is
          affected by that which one practices and engages in. This means it is
          something that has to be consciously focussed on in order to utilise
          this form of mental understanding. <br />Source:

      <p>Growth Mindset</p>
      <div id="text2">
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is generally best described in comparison to its
          opposite: the Fixed Mindset. A fixed mindset involves the belief that
          intelligence and understanding is "fixed" and cannot be altered or
          improved upon, whereas a growth mindset involves the belief that these
          traits <i>can</i> be improved and changed through challenges and
          persistence. A fixed mindset sees a challenge as an unsurmountable
          obstacle, while a growth mindset would see it as an opportunity to
          learn and improve oneself. This ultimately leads to a difference
          between a sense of determinism versus free will, respectively. Both in
          upcoming and indeed previous sections of this course a growth mindset
          would be vital for making sure I do not simply give up when struggling
          but rather see it as an opportunity to learn, and indeed grow. <br />

        <p>
          Neuroplasticity and a growth mindset will be extremely beneficial for
          both going into solving a problem with an open mind, and being willing
          to put in the work to push through any struggles as this will
          ultimately be beneficial in gaining experience in both the given topic
          and problem solving in general. Training neuroplasticity will help
          enable the understanding of key skills throughout the course, while a
          growth mindset will be beneficial for self motivation as well as
          aiding the actual completion of projects and moving through areas that
          I struggle in.
